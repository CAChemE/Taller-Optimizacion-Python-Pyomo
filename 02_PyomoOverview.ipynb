    "This chapter provides an introduction to Pyomo: Python Optimization Modeling Objects. A more complete description is contained in [Pyomo - Optimization Modeling in Python](http://www.springer.com/us/book/9781461432258). Pyomo supports the formulation and analysis of mathematical models for complex optimization applications. This capability is commonly associated with algebraic modeling languages (AMLs) such as [AMPL](http://www.ampl.com), [AIMMS](http://www.aimms.com/), and [GAMS](http://www.gams.com). Pyomo’s modeling objects are embedded within Python, a full-featured high-level programming language that contains a rich set of supporting libraries.\n",
    "Modeling is a fundamental process in many aspects of scientific research, engineering and business. Modeling involves the formulation of a simplified representation of a system or real-world object. Thus, modeling tools like Pyomo can be used in a variety of ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Explain** phenomena that arise in a system,\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Make predictions** about future states of a system,\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Assess key factors** that influence phenomena in a system,\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Identify extreme states** in a system, that might represent worst-case scenarios or minimal cost plans, and\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Analyze trade-offs** to support human decision makers.\n",
    "\n",
    "Mathematical models represent system knowledge with a formalized mathematical language. The following mathematical concepts are central to modern modeling activities:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Variables\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Variables**Variables represent unknown or changing parts of a model\n",
    "    (e.g. whether or not to make a decision, or the characteristic of \n",
    "    a system outcome).The values taken by the variables are often\n",
    "    referred to as a <span style=\"color:dakrblue\">*solution*</span> and are usually an output of the\n",
    "    optimization process.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Parameters\n",
    "\n",
    "- Parameters represents the data that must be supplied to perform\n",
    "    theoptimization. In fact, in some settings the word <span style=\"color:darkblue\">*data*</span> is used in\n",
    "    place of the word <span style=\"color:dakrblue\">*parameters*</span>.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Relations\n",
    "\n",
    "- These are equations, inequalities or other mathematical relationships\n",
    "    that define how different parts of a model are connected to each\n",
    "    other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Goals\n",
    "\n",
    "- These are functions that reflect goals and objectives for the system\n",
    "    being modeled.\n",
    "\n",
    "The widespread availability of computing resources has made the numerical analysis of mathematical models a commonplace activity. Without a modeling language, the process of setting up input files, executing a solver and extracting the final results from the solver output is tedious and error prone. This difficulty is compounded in complex, large-scale real-world applications which are difficult to debug when errors occur. Additionally, there are many different formats used by optimization software packages, and few formats are recognized by many optimizers. Thus the application of multiple optimization solvers to analyze a model introduces additional complexities.\n",
    "\n",
    "Pyomo is an AML that extends Python to include objects for mathematical modeling. Hart et al. [PyomoBook](https://software.sandia.gov/downloads/pub/pyomo/PyomoOnlineDocs.html#PyomoBook), [PyomoJournal](https://software.sandia.gov/downloads/pub/pyomo/PyomoOnlineDocs.html#PyomoJournal) compare Pyomo with other AMLs. Although many good AMLs have been developed for optimization models, the following are motivating factors for the development of Pyomo:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Open Source\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pyomo is developed within Pyomo’s open source project to promote\n",
    "    transparency of the modeling framework and encourage community\n",
    "    development of Pyomo capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Customizable Capability\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pyomo supports a customizable capability through the extensive use \n",
    "    of plug-ins to modularize software components.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solver Integration\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pyomo models can be optimized with solvers that are written either in\n",
    "    Python or in compiled, low-level languages.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Programming Language\n",
    "\n",
    "- Pyomo leverages a high-level programming language, which has several\n",
    "    advantages over custom AMLs: a very robust language, extensive\n",
    "    documentation, a rich set of standard libraries, support for modern\n",
    "    programming features like classes and functions, and portability to\n",
    "    many platforms."

    "In abstract models, Pyomo expressions are usually provided to objective function and constraint declarations via a function defined with a Python <span style=\"color:darkblue; font-family:Courier\">def</span> statement. The <span style=\"color:darkblue; font-family:Courier\">def</span> statement establishes a name for a function along with its arguments. When Pyomo uses a function to get objective function or constraint expressions, it always passes in the model (i.e., itself) as the the first argument so the model is always the first formal argument when declaring such functions in Pyomo. Additional arguments, if needed, follow. Since summation is an extremely common part of optimization models, Pyomo provides a flexible function to accommodate it. When given two arguments, the <span style=\"color:darkblue; font-family:Courier\">summation</span> function returns an expression for the sum of the product of the two arguments over their indexes. This only works, of course, if the two arguments have the same indexes. If it is given only one argument it returns an expression for the sum over all indexes of that argument.
