    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of the Transport Problem is to select the quantities of an homogeneous good that has several production plants and several punctiform markets as to minimise the transportation costs.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is the default tutorial for the GAMS language, and GAMS equivalent code is inserted as single-dash comments. The original GAMS code needs slighly different ordering of the commands and it's available at http://www.gams.com/mccarl/trnsport.gms.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Problem Statement\n",
    "\n",
    "The Transport Problem can be formulated mathematically as a linear programming problem using the following model.  \n",
    "\n",
    "### Sets\n",
    "\n",
    " $I$ = set of canning plants  \n",
    " $J$ = set of markets\n",

    " $c_{i,j}$ = transport cost in thousands of dollars per case\n",

    " $c_{i,j}$ is obtained exougenously to the optimisation problem as $c_{i,j} = f \\cdot d_{i,j}$, $\\forall i \\in I, \\forall j \\in J$\n",

    " $x_{i,j}$ = shipment quantities in cases <br />\n",

    "\n",
    "Minimize the total cost of the shipments: <br />\n",
    "$\\min_{x} z = \\sum_{i \\in I} \\sum_{j \\in J} c_{i,j} x_{i,j}$\n",

    "\n",
    "There are two type of models in pyomo: A `ConcreteModel` is one where all the data is defined at the model creation. We are going to use this type of model in this tutorial. Pyomo however supports also an `AbstractModel`, where the model structure is firstly generated and then particular instances of the model are generated with a particular set of data.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first thing to do in the script is to load the pyomo library and create a new `ConcreteModel` object. We have little imagination here, and we call our model \"model\". You can give it whatever name you want. However, if you give your model an other name, you also need to create a `model` object at the end of your script:"
